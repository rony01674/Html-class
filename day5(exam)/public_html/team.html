                    <dd>Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely populated countries,
                        with its people crammed into a delta of rivers that empties into the Bay of Bengal. </dd>
                    <dd>Poverty is deep and widespread,

                    <dd>Formerly East Pakistan, Bangladesh came into being only in 1971,
                        when the two parts of Pakistan split after a bitter war which drew in neighbouring India.</dd>
                    <dd>Bangladesh spent 15 years under military rule and,
                        although democracy was restored in 1990, the political scene remains volatile.</dd>
                    <dd>Islamist extremism has been rising in the usually tolerant country. </dd>
                    <dd>The low-lying country is vulnerable to flooding and cyclones, and stands to be badly affected by any rises in sea levels. </dd>
